# File renamer
[This](main.sh) script fills in the right amount of zeroes on the name of a file contained in a directory. This became useful when I would solve tons of exercises in pages like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/gustin33), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/gustin33) and [Project Euler](https://github.com/agustinntarias/project_euler).
### Example 1
name12 -> name012
### Example 2
name2 -> name002
